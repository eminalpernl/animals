Bobcats

The bobcat's fur is buff to brown, sometimes with a reddish tinge, and marked with spots or stripes of brown and black. The fur on its undersides is lighter in color. Bobcats have facial ruffs, ear tufts, white spots near the tips of their ears and bobbed tails.




Caracal Lynx

Caracals are very striking cats. They have short, reddish-brown fur on their back and flanks, which is set off by the white fur on the chin, throat and belly. Most notably, long tufts of black fur top the caracal's ears, which are long and slender. Caracals, sometimes called desert lynx, are not actually members of the lynx family though many people confuse them with lynx because of their ear tufts.




California Sea Leon

Sea lions, along with fur seals, are considered eared seals. Their visible ear flaps distinguish them from true seals. They also use their fore flippers to propel themselves through the water, whereas true seals rely primarily on their back flippers to swim.





Common Raven

Ravens are massive birds with a thick neck and distinctive shaggy throat feathers. Like other corvids, ravens have strong, large feet and long bills. Most ravens are a solid black. Ravens most closely resemble the common crow, but they soar in flight, more like a hawk. Another distinguishing feature from crows are their slender wings and wedge shaped tail.



Corn Snake

Corn snakes, sometimes called red rat snakes, are slender, orange or brownish-yellow snakes with a pattern of large, red blotches outlined in black down their backs.
